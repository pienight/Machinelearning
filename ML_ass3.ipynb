        "In the development of human society, it is difficult to say that there is a stage in which crime in any form can be completely avoided. Crime has an extremely bad impact on social security and people's lives. At any stage of human society, crime needs to be concerned. According to the research of Barak, Leighton & Flavin (2010), crime is a violation of a legalized social norm that carries a penal sanction. After I did data visualization of Los Angeles crime data with my team members, the occurrence of crime seems to be related to the characteristics of both the offender and the victim. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop a new design that combining AI technology and big data to predict the crime. This product would use the latest crime data from CCTV and crime reports to collect crime data and analyse how people behave when they want crimes. We would develop methods to predict criminal behaviors via deep learning technology. The results might be different due to different culture and regions. Our work could also focus on the information of victims and provide possible victims’ characteristics for people to reduce the possibility of victimization. This project will help to improve public order, support police in adjudicating cases, reduce crime and protect citizens’ safety."

The software will analyze the input information and output the prediction results of crime. Generally, the software will alarm the time exceeding a certain probability according to the settings, reminding the relevant personnel to pay attention. In practical application, the application may also need to combine geographic information to predict the location of the crime. Therefore, software should have more interfaces to facilitate customization for different needs. At the same time, the software should also set up many security settings such as firewalls to avoid any form of damage, such as data leakage. Software should also update the model regularly to ensure the validity of prediction."
